# Apiman (Open Source API Management)

Apiman is a flexible and open source API Management platform.

With just a few clicks you can get Apiman running, putting a platform at your fingertips that covers the whole API Management lifecycle. Whether you want to offer existing APIs to external consumers in a secure way, or have a centralised location to discover and govern APIs, Apiman has you covered.

But that's not all. Apiman is designed to be easy to customise, and you can implement your own functionality by writing simple Java plugins.

## üìñ Requirements

- Java 11+
- To build Apiman with tests: Docker or an equivalent container engine. This is for running tests with [testcontainers](https://www.testcontainers.org/supported_docker_environment/). 
- Naturally, if you're using an Apiman container, you'll need it for runtime too!

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Quickstart

You can look at the Apiman [quickstarts on apiman.io](https://www.apiman.io).

Or, you can build and run our 'server-all' quickstart to try everything out immediately.

Here's what you need to do:

```bash
echo "Cloning Apiman"
git clone https://github.com/apiman/apiman.git && cd apiman

echo "Building Apiman"
./fastbuild.sh

echo "Starting a Keycloak container with a demo Apiman realm"
cd tools/server-all/target/docker
docker compose up -d

echo "Starting Apiman WildFly Quickstart" && cd ../
./wildfly-dev-server/bin/standalone.sh
```

Once Apiman has started up, and if all went well, you can point your browser to the API Manager via http://localhost:8080/apimanui/ and log in (either register a new user or log in as the admin):

* Username: `admin`
* Password: `admin123!`

You can log into the Keycloak admin console via http://localhost:8085/admin (same credentials as above).

This quickstart seeds a bunch of content into apiman. This is not strictly necessary, but it does populate the API Manager with some data so that it doesn't feel so lonely the first time you log in.

There's also a handy echo service available at http://localhost:8080/services/echo - it's useful for demos. You're welcome!

‚ö†Ô∏è Please don't use Apiman's default usernames, passwords, keys, certificates, etc., in production.

## ‚öíÔ∏è Build Apiman

### Fast and easy

The easiest way to build quickly (without tests) is to run our [fastbuild script](https://github.com/apiman/apiman/blob/master/fastbuild.sh). It's in the root of the project. If you have [mvnd](https://github.com/apache/maven-mvnd/) the build will be faster.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/apiman/apiman.git && cd apiman
./fastbuild.sh 
```

### I want to run the tests

First, build the parent pom (it's in `/parent`), then you can build the main project from the top level.

```shell
echo "Building Apiman Parent..."
cd parent
../mvnw clean install

cd ..
echo "Building the main Apiman project..."
./mvnw clean install
```
