== Workflows

=== `docker-test-release`

Reusable workflow that can build and release Docker images.

It is called from several other workflows.

If new images are added to the repository, then this workflow should be updated.

Callers can decide which Apiman version to use, and whether to push the images to the Docker repos, hence this workflow can be in a 'build-only' mode if desired.

=== `pull-request-verify`

For PRs:

* Calls `docker-test-release`
** Reads release version
** Does a build-only run

* Calls `docker-test-release` (again)
** Reads snapshot version
** Does a build-only run
